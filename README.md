# Royal Shift was made for GMTK23

Royal Shift was created for GMTK23.

You can play it here: https://ponporio.itch.io/game-jam-gmtk-2023

We decided to Open-Source it as we probably wont have much time to fix it up ourselves.
You are free to use and change all the art assets and code in the game however you want even in commercial way and this includes reselling the game itself.
Beware of the sound effects.
